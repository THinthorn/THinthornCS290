            <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
            <h2>Tyler Hinthorn, hinthort@oregonstate.edu</h2>
            <p>I'm Tyler Hinthorn, a 2nd year computer science major at OSU. I've never done anything with </p>
            <p>web development, but I am hoping to learn how to make a website that doesn't crash when
                you open it.</p>
            <p>I have already signed up for Campuswire because I got like 5 emails telling me to.</p>
            <p>I don't have too many fun facts about myself, but I need to integrate a list in this
                website somehow so here's a list of things about me that may or may not be true:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>My thumbs are different shapes and sizes</strong> <em>(this ones true)</em></li>
                <li>I'm 40% dolphin</li>
                <li>I can control people's minds</li>
                <li>I was raised in a fish tank in the White House</li>
                <li>I'm bad at thinking of fun facts</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I want to include an ordered list in this somehow, so here's my personal opinion
                of all the Star Wars movies from best to worst:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The Empire Strikes Back</li>
                <li>Rogue One</li>
                <li>A New Hope</li>
                <li>Revenge of the Sith</li>
                <li>Return of the Jedi</li>
                <li>The Phantom Menace</li>
                <li>The Force Awakens</li>
                <li>Attack of the Clones</li>
                <li>The Rise of Skywalker</li>
                <li>The Last Jedi</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Feel free to disagree. Everyone deserves an opinion, some of them just happen
                to be wrong (like people who think The Last Jedi is good).
            </p>
