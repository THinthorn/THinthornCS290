            <p>The main challenge that I faced in this assignment was the setting up of 
                github and trying to learn how to upload repositorys and all that. In this 
                assignment, I learned the basics of HTML and its formatting. I didn't really 
                know anything about HTML beforehand, so pretty much everything in this 
                assignment was new to me. The only resources I used were my own notes and
                the git it tutorial. I used my notes for the actual HTML part of the assignment
                and just followed the git it directions.
